# Road Accident Data Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
Road accidents are a major public safety concern, resulting in injuries, fatalities, and economic loss every year.  
This project analyzes road accident data for the years **2021–2022** using **Power BI** to identify patterns related to accident severity, casualties, time trends, vehicle types, weather conditions, road surface, and geographic distribution.

The goal of this project is to transform raw accident data into **interactive and insightful dashboards** that support data-driven understanding and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze road accident trends for the years 2021–2022  
- Study accident severity and casualty distribution  
- Perform year-wise and monthly trend analysis  
- Analyze the impact of vehicle types, weather, and road surface conditions  
- Compare accidents across urban vs rural areas and day vs night  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploratory analysis

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using **Power BI Power Query Editor**:
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency  
- Corrected incorrectly spelled values  
- Handled missing and inconsistent data  
- Verified and corrected data types  
- Filtered invalid records  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns before visualization
